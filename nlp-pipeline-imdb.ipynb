This high dimensionality can make the model computationally expensive and harder to train.\n","\n","Sparse Data:\n","\n","The resulting one-hot encoded data is sparse, containing many zeros. Sparse matrices can lead to inefficiencies in storage and processing.\n","\n","Curse of Dimensionality:\n","\n","The increase in dimensionality can lead to the curse of dimensionality, where the performance of machine learning algorithms degrades with the addition of too many features.\n","\n","Scalability Issues:\n","\n","For large datasets with high cardinality categorical variables, one-hot encoding may not be scalable and can result in memory and computational challenges.\n","\n","Irrelevance in Some Algorithms:\n","\n","Some machine learning algorithms, like decision trees, do not benefit from one-hot encoding as they can handle categorical data directly.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":35,"id":"a161d592","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.592527Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.592191Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.59674Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.595971Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.024397,"end_time":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.598205","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.573808","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","corpus = [\n","    'People Follow Mr.Beast',\n","    'Mr.Beast Follow Mr.Beast',\n","    'People Write comment',\n","    'Mr.Beast Write comment'\n","]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":36,"id":"0fccdce2","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.634768Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.633817Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.650433Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.649495Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.036336,"end_time":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.651818","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.615482","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["   beast  comment  follow  mr  people  write\n","0      1        0       1   1       1      0\n","1      1        0       1   1       0      0\n","2      0        1       0   0       1      1\n","3      1        1       0   1       0      1\n"]}],"source":["# Initialize CountVectorizer with binary=True for One-Hot Encoding\n","vectorizer = CountVectorizer(binary=True)\n","\n","# Fit and transform the text data\n","X_onehot = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)\n","\n","# Convert to a DataFrame for better readability\n","df_onehot = pd.DataFrame(X_onehot.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())\n","\n","# Show the result\n","print(df_onehot)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"37a03004","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.017308,"end_time":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.686548","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-08-01T18:20:01.66924","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# **Bag of words¶**\n","\n","\n","The core intuition behind the Bag of Words (BoW) model is that if our algorithm detects similar words occurring with similar frequencies, it will classify the documents as being in the same class.
